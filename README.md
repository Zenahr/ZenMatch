# ZenMatch - Simple and free matchmaking solution for indie game developers & gamejam projects

## What problem does ZenMatch solve for you?

- Ever wanted to add multiplayer to your game but didn't know how to connect players?
- Didn't know how to populate a serverlist in your game that people can use to join existing game instances?
- [EOS]() is too complicated/time-intensive for you and [Steamworks]() costs too much? That's what ZenMatch is there for

## What you can do with ZenMatch

- Host your own matchmaking server online
- Allow players to find servers that run your game

## How it works

ZenMatch comes with two components:

- Client Library (for Unreal Engine that is the [ZenMatchPlugin (to be developed)]())

## How it all began

I needed a simple, barebones matchmaking solution for my side projects and I haven't found any that I liked. They were either pricey, or needed advanced C++ skills and Unreal API knowledge (and we know that C++ in Unreal Engine is a bit slow in terms of development time).
